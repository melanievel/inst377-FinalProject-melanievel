            diet, intolerance, and cuisine. When the form is submitted, a list of recipes that meet all of the chosen categories will be displayed. 
            Once the user looks through the recipe results, they can copy the id of a recipe they liked and paste it in the search bar to the right. 
            When they click submit, they'll be able to see more details about the recipe such as a full link to the recipe source, instructions, and more!
