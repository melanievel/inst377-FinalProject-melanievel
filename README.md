INST377 Final Project - Recipes website

The purpose of this website is to give college students recipe ideas to improve their nutrition. Many college students don't practice good nutrition for different reasons; financial reasons, poor time management, not being sufficiently skilled at cooking, etc. This website allows students to find recipes based on their specific circumstances. They have the option to click and choose different options to narrow down their search. 

This website is meant for both iOS and Android browsers.
