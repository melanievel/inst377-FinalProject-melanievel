    <h3>Issue</h3>
    <p>
      College students often struggle to maintain a good nutrition. Depending on
      their circumstances they may have issues with time management, finances
      and budgeting, cooking, etc., all which affect their ability to access
      nutritious meals.
    </p>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this app is to facilitate college students' access to
      nutritious meals! The app allows users to find recipes that fit their
      needs. Users have the choice to add customizations to narrow down their
      recipe search. They can also see the ingredients needed, the time it takes
      to make the recipe, how much it would cost to prepare it, etc. These
      features allow the users to decide which recipes are a good fir for them
      based on how much time they have, their budget, their cooking skills, and
      more!
    </p>
    <h3>Resources</h3>
    <p>
      All recipe information was pulled from the Spoonacular API. Visit their
      website to learn more about the API and its features.
